This mod support DeepRim mod. Please load this mod after DeepRim.
The mod Set-up Camp doesn't support this mod. Set-up Camp mod doesn't allow to set up camp on any tile that has a world object, and speciality is world object. So you can't set up camp. It's pitty, but I can't solve that problem by my self. I have posted on Nandonalt's forum thread, We have to wait for some while though.
